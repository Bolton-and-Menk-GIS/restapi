Release notes for restapi version 1.0, which was a major overhaul on this package to include many performance and convenience improvements.

New Classes:
	
	GeometryService
	GeometryCollection
	FeatureSet
	RelatedRecords
	Feature

New Base Classes:

	JsonGetter
	RestapiEncoder
	SpatialReferenceMixin
	BaseGeometryCollection

Deprecated Functions (many of these have been converted to class methods):
	
	query
	query_all
	list_layers
	list_tables
	list_fields
	walk
	objectize

Major changes:

	Cursor -- this has been completely rewritten as an extension of the new FeatureSet class.  The row class is also no longer
		globally exposed and is now an attribute of the Cursor.
	ArcServer -- in versions < 1.0, this would build the service list for the entire REST services directory at initialization,
		this no longer happens to improve performance.  The "services" property has also changed to represent just the services
		at the root level.  A new property has been implemented called "service_cache", which is initially empty upon initialization
		and gets populated whenever a call to iter_services, list_services, or walk is called.

Misc changes:
	FeatureLayer is now a subclass of MapServiceLayer, so now you get all the methods available in the MapServiceLayer that weren't previously 
		available.
	The query() method of MapServiceLayer/FeatureLayer "get_all" argument has been changed to "exceed_limit".  This parameter allows you to 
		make repetitive calls to gather features by exceeding the maxRecordCount of the service.
